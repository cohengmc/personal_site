      <p>Peanut butter and jelly on an open face Everything is one of my favorite foods. Another alternative that slaps is a blueberry bagel toasted with peanut butter open face. The blueberries bring the sweetness like the jelly and then because its toasted, the peanut butter gets super runny. Liquid gold.</p>
